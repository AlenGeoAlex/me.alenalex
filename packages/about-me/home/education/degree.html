        Plot twist: turns out I <span class="text-amber-400 font-bold">WAS</span> a bright bulb, just been plugged into the wrong outlet this whole time. Computers spoke my language. While my high school self was getting roasted by Physics equations, my college self was finally cooking with code.

        You know that moment in every movie where the underdog decides "enough is enough"? Yeah, that was me in 2020. Time to speedrun my way back to academic respectability. If my school years were a bug-filled beta release, college was going to be the stable version 2.0.

        <p>Went absolutely feral with learning. Databases? Conquered. Linux? Became best friends (finally, an OS that didn't hide everything in a GUI). Networking? Figured out it's not just about making friends. Data Structures and Algorithms? Turned out arrays and I got along better than me and the periodic table ever did. Cloud computing? Learned to keep my head in the clouds productively.</p>
        <p class="text-purple-300 italic">Oh, and the curriculum? That was just the tutorial level. The real game was everything outside of it.</p>
