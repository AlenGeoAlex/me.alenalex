## Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)
**MG University** | 2020 - 2023

### The Great Awakening
Plot twist: turns out I **WAS** a bright bulb, just been plugged into the wrong outlet this whole time. Computers spoke my language. While my high school self was getting roasted by Physics equations, my college self was finally cooking with code.

### The Revenge Arc Begins
You know that moment in every movie where the underdog decides "enough is enough"? Yeah, that was me in 2020. Time to speedrun my way back to academic respectability. If my school years were a bug-filled beta release, college was going to be the stable version 2.0.

### The Learning Frenzy
Went absolutely feral with learning. Databases? Conquered. Linux? Became best friends (finally, an OS that didn't hide everything in a GUI). Networking? Figured out it's not just about making friends. Data Structures and Algorithms? Turned out arrays and I got along better than me and the periodic table ever did. Cloud computing? Learned to keep my head in the clouds productively.

Oh, and the curriculum? That was just the tutorial level. The real game was everything outside of it.

### The Side Hustle Era
Started freelancing because apparently sleep is optional when you're having fun. Turns out people actually pay you to solve problems with code. Revolutionary concept isn't it!!

### Academic Redemption Unlocked
Published a few research papers because why stop at just passing when you can contribute to actual knowledge?
- [Review on Web Scrapping](https://ijarsct.co.in/Paper4902.pdf)
- [An Overview about Smart Contracts](https://www.ijsdr.org/papers/IJSDR2303221.pdf)

Graduated with over 80% - a percentage I didn't think existed in my academic universe. From "Did I pass?" to "Wait, I'm actually good at this?" 

**Achievement Unlocked:** Life back on track. Controller reconnected.
