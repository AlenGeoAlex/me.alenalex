## PhD Plans
**Status:** TBD (To Be Determined... or To Be Delayed)

Currently in the "nothing really peaked my interest enough to commit 4+ years of my life" phase. You know, that classic stage where you're qualified enough to do research but indecisive enough to postpone it.

The plan exists in a superposition of states: simultaneously pursuing it and not pursuing it. Will collapse into a definite state when the right research topic observes me.

**Current PhD Status:** `null` (not `undefined`, because I'm aware it should exist)
