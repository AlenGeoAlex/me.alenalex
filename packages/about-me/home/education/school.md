## High School
**Alphonsa Residential School** | ICSE Syllabus | From somewhere late 2000's to 2018ish

Let's just say I wasn't exactly the brightest bulb in the chandelier. Physics was like trying to read ancient hieroglyphics, Chemistry felt like following a recipe where every ingredient exploded, and Maths... well, we had a complicated relationship. Think of it as me being a software developer stuck in a hardware store - I knew the tools existed, just wasn't quite sure why I needed them yet.

## Higher Secondary
**Alphonsa Residential School** | ISC Syllabus | Class of 2018

Same school, different syllabus, same guy who still thought the periodic table was more of a suggestion than a requirement and why does integretion feels like some ancient relic that should be taught with history...But hey, I made it through! Finished my last exam just as the pandemic started knocking on our country's door - talk about perfect timing. While others got their exams postponed, I was already out. Sometimes being early has its perks, even if my exam answers didn't always reflect that.
