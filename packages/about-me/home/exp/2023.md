### Software Engineer @ [Idea Elan](https://ideaelan.com/)
**2023 - 2025** | Full-time

Started as a Junior Software Engineer. Blinked. Became a Software Engineer within a year. Apparently, they liked what I was doing.

**The Stack & The Chaos:**
- Primary weapons of choice: .NET and Angular. Turns out C# and TypeScript go together like coffee and late nights.
- Wore multiple hats: Developer, R&D lead, System Architect. Sometimes all three in the same meeting.

**The "I Actually Did This" Highlights:**
- Optimized their Redis cache invalidation from a painful 10+ seconds to under 1 second. Yes, someone noticed those 9 seconds. Everyone noticed those 9 seconds.
- Led R&D for migrating their legacy WPF application to Electron. Because apparently, I enjoy challenging projects that make other developers say "why?"
- Worked on their in-house AI system. Tried Langchain. It tried us. Eventually said "screw it" and built our own framework. Sometimes the best solution is the one you write yourself.
- Optimized APIs and background jobs because slow code is the enemy of productivity (and my sanity).

**The Trophy Shelf:**
- **3 months in:** Brilliant Beginner Award - "Wait, they're rewarding me for just doing my job?"
- **1 year in:** Spot Award - Apparently, I spotted something important
- **December 2024:** Employee of the Year - Still processing this one. Pretty sure I peaked here.

Handled a lot. Learned more. Left with battle scars and production-level code.
