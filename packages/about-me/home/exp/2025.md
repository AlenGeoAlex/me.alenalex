### Contract Angular Developer @ [Stag AI](https://www.stag-ai.com/)
**January 2025 - Present** | Remote Contract

Currently building a pharma application because apparently, my Angular skills are prescription-strength. Working on a contract basis, which is a fancy way of saying I get to solve problems without attending all the meetings. The pharma app is coming along nicely, one component at a time.
