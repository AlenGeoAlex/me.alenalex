### Freelance Developer & Server Owner
**2020 - 2023** | Self-employed (a.k.a. Unemployed but Productive) to Employed but unoffically! 

**The Beginning:** Started with Discord bots and Minecraft plugin development. Built stuff for clients. Built stuff for myself. Built stuff just to see if I could.

**Kerala Gamers Official (KGO Network):**
The passion project that taught me everything they don't teach in textbooks. Launched a Minecraft server and somehow convinced 5 people to join. One month later, we hit 100+ concurrent players at peak.

This wasn't just ***"running a Minecraft server"*** - this was a crash course in everything:
- **People Management:** Learned to manage everyone from 10-year-olds screaming in voice chat to adults who should know better. Turns out, both groups are equally chaotic.
- **Technical Deep Dive:** Went from "what's an OS?" to understanding threading models. From spinning up GCP instances to managing dedicated servers. From basic JavaScript to... well, still JavaScript, but the advanced kind.
- **Real-world DevOps:** Because when 100+ players are online and the server crashes, you learn to debug FAST.

The server taught me more about distributed systems, resource management, and crisis handling than any course ever could. Also taught me that server hosting is expensive and community management is exhausting.

**Client Work:** Built Discord bots that actually worked, Minecraft plugins that didn't crash servers (mostly), and gained real-world experience getting paid to code. Revolutionary concept.

**The Real Achievement:** Survived freelancing as a college student. If you can manage client expectations while juggling exams, you can manage anything.
