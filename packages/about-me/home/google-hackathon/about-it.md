**Google BGN Ireland Hackathon 2025** | 2nd Place Winner 🏆

**Google Dublin (Gordon House)** | October 2024

### ▶ The Dublin Incursion
Barely a month after landing in Cork for my Master’s at UCC, I found myself into Google’s Gordon House in Dublin. I’d like to say it was a calculated move for my career, but honestly, I think I just followed the scent of free premium coffee xD 😆.

I ended up staying for three days, fueled by caffeine and the sheer audacity of trying to build something cool surrounded by people much smarter than me.

### ▶ Project: TestBuddy 🚗💨
We built an AI-powered driving test sidekick. My logic was simple: **since my relationship with Physics and Maths was already "complicated," I might as well help people navigate something even more stressful—the Irish driving test**. We spent 72 hours in a cycle of building, breaking things, and then staring at the code until it finally apologized and started working. The judges liked our "why" as much as our "how," and somehow, we walked away with **2nd place**.

### ▶ The "Is This Real Life?" Moment
The highlight was definitely having **Vanessa Hartley (VP of Google Ireland)** personally hand us our prizes. I spent most of that moment trying to look like a functioning, professional adult while internally screaming because, well, it’s Google. It was a total **"glitch in the matrix" moment for a guy who once thought the periodic table was just a list of suggestions**.

### ▶ Lessons from the Trenches
A massive shout-out to **Eche** for pulling us out of the over-engineering rabbit hole, and **Swasthik** for the pep talks. This weekend taught me that while we engineers love to solve things at 100mph, the real impact starts when you actually stop and understand the problem first. Also, I can confirm that Google’s snack selection is 10/10.

**Team:** Chinaza Ogwudiegwu, Omotayo Taoreed, Mahmoud Alimi, & Faith Ogundimu.
