## Homelab & Self-Hosting

### ▶ The Infinite Rabbit Hole
If you ever find my home internet down, it’s likely because I tried to *“optimize”* a config file at 2 AM. My digital life is powered by a fleet of **20+ self-hosted services**, all neatly orchestrated and tucked away under **custom subdomains** on my main domain. It’s less of a hobby and more of a full-time job where I am the *unpaid* CEO, SysAdmin, and the guy who accidentally wipes the `docker-compose.yml`.

### ▶ The Fleet 🚀
My lab is a chaotic masterpiece of utility and "because I can." I’ve got everything from **Vaultwarden** (managing my secrets better than I managed my school notes) to **Jellyfin** (the only reason I haven't lost my mind during exam season). It’s a support group for people who enjoy paying for electricity to run services that Google provides for free.

I document my digital adventures—and the occasional *catastrophic* failure—over at **[blogs.alenalex.me](https://blogs.alenalex.me)**. Think of it as a *“What Not To Do”* guide for developers. Check it out if you want to see how I turn a "simple" setup into a complex architecture requiring three reboots and a prayer to stay online.
