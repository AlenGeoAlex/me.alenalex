### ▶ The Keyboard Chronicles
I started my musical journey at **grade 5**, squeezed right in between learning to tie my shoes and realizing school was going to be a long, *confusing* ride. While other kids were out playing, I was busy negotiating with a keyboard. I’ve reached a point where I can play most things—usually the **right notes**, and *occasionally* in the right order.

### ▶ The 200,000 Minute Flex
If **"Listening to Music"** were an Olympic sport, I’d be on the podium. My **Spotify Wrapped** and **YT Music** stats are basically a cry for help. I clock in around **200,000 minutes a year** combined. That’s roughly **138 days** of straight music. If my brain isn't processing code, it’s processing a bassline. Music is the one thing I keep closer to my heart than my everything else.
